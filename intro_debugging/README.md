# C - Debugging Visualization with Python Tutor

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, i will be able to:

- Explain what debugging is and why step-by-step tracing is necessary.

- Use Python Tutor to:

	- execute C code line by line,
	- inspect variable values at each step,
	- follow loop and nested loop execution,
	- observe how functions are called and return values.

- Identify and fix common logic errors involving:

	- off-by-one loop conditions,
	- incorrect loop control variables,
	- improper variable updates,
	- incorrect use of function return values.

- Submit corrected C programs that compile cleanly and produce the expected output.

## Project Requirements

These rules apply to all tasks:

- You may only use:

	- variables
	- if / else
	- loops (for, while)
	- nested loops
	- functions

- You may not use:

	- pointers
	- arrays
	- structs
	- dynamic memory
	- file I/O

- Your code must compile with: ```gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89```

- Output must match exactly, including spaces and newlines.
- The checker will compile and run your submitted code independently.
